“My... my wings?”

“Right. Yeah.”

“I guess you would be curious about that at some point...”

“I was expecting this.”

[fairy name] lifted a hand to his shoulder.

“It's not easy, you know? Being a fairy without wings.”

“The other fairies don't accept you as one of theirs anymore.”

“They'll laugh at you and mock you.”

He paused a moment and let out a short breathy laugh.

“Our wings are our pride. Our freedom. They distinguish us from the rest.”

“I guess it sounds conceited now that I think about it.”

“I'm a fairy no longer. I look like one of you boring humans now. But I'm not even that either.”

“...I'm not anything. Not any longer”

[ask about fairy society]

I've grown up with stories of fairy tricksters and magical kingdoms. Everything full of laughter and mirth.

Were they all just that? Stories?

MC – Are the fae really so bad?
MC – I've always heard so many stories about them. But nothing much of their cruelty.

He looked at me a moment. Baffled, almost. As if he couldn't believe what just came out of my mouth.

I stayed silent and waited patiently for him to continue.

“Are you not familiar with folklore? They all describe ways of keeping fairies at a distance. That alone should tell you what they're like.”

MC – I know that they're pranksters


[how did you lose your wings]

MC – What about you? How did you lose your wings?

[FN] opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out.

MC – [FN], you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.

“I'd rather not. Is there anything else you want to ask me?”
