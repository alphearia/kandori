“My... my wings?”

“Right. Yeah.”

“I guess you would be curious about that at some point...”

“I was expecting this.”

[fairy name] lifted a hand to his shoulder.

“It's not easy, you know? Being a fairy without wings.”

“The other fairies...”

He paused a moment and let out a short breathy laugh.

“Our wings are our pride. Our freedom. They distinguish us from the rest.”

“I guess it sounds conceited now that I think about it.”

“To be a fairy without wings, is to be a fairy no more.”

“Or at least... that's what they told me.”

“I can't deny it. I won't deny it. To be a fairy is to have wings. Our wings make us freedom.”

“They distinguish us from the rest...”

“I'm a fairy no longer. I look like one of you boring humans now. But I'm not even that either.”

“...I'm not anything. Not any longer”


MC – So, how did you lose them?

[ask about fairy society]

I've grown up with stories of fairy tricksters and magical kingdoms. Everything full of laughter and mirth.

Was all that really... a lie?

MC – Are the fae really so bad?
MC – I've always heard so many stories about them. But nothing much of their cruelty.

He looked at me a moment. Baffled, almost. As if he couldn't believe what just came out of my mouth.

I stayed silent and waited patiently for him to continue.

“They're worse. They're far worse than you could ever even dream.”

“Nowadays all you see in media is about their playful natures and helpfulness. Prone to pranks, but still generally kind.”

“Older humans knew better. They knew it was best to avoid them.”

“Fairies are cruel. Very cruel.”

“The very second I lost my wings, I was cast out from society.”

“Like I said, to be a fairy without wings is to be a fairy no longer.”

“Wings are a sort of a status symbol and a thing of beauty. Whereas you humans take pride in your hair, they take pride in their wings.”

“It's also a form of identification. Every wing pattern is different. Like your fingerprints.”

MC – So without wings...

“Exactly. I have no identity.”

“The worst punishment the Court can give a fairy is the removal of their wings.”

“It's a painful procedure. Both physically and mentally.”
