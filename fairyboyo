"My wings? The fuck do you care about those for?"

“I mean I guess it's kinda weird. I'm like a fairy and shit. Usually fairies have that sort of thing.”

"It's probably better this way anyway. I hate them all."

[fairy name] lifted a hand to his shoulder.

“So, like, what do you wanna know?”

[ask about how fairies react to not having wings]

MC- So what do the other fairies think about someone who doesn't have wings?

"They're all little shits."

I paused and waited for him to continue.

MC- ...

"..."

MC- ...That's it?

I blinked at him.

"How descriptive do you want me to get? They laugh? Call names? Point and mock?"

"They're little shits like I said."

"Anything else?"

[ask about fairy society]

I've grown up with stories of fairy tricksters and magical kingdoms. Everything full of laughter and mirth.

Were they all just that? Stories?

MC – Are the fae really so bad?
MC – I've always heard so many stories about them. But nothing much of their cruelty.

He looked at me a moment. Baffled, almost. As if he couldn't believe what just came out of my mouth.

I stayed silent and waited patiently for him to continue.

“Aren't you familiar with the legends? They all describe ways of keeping fairies at a distance. That alone should tell you how shitty they are.”

MC – I know that they're pranksters, but that's about it.

"Yeah, pranksters works, I guess. They like messing with humans. Some in worse ways than others."

"They find it really funny when they make a human lose a limb or two."

MC - ...lose a limb?

[fairy name] chuckled and gave me a wry smile.

That smile bothered me.

"Anything else?"

[how did you lose your wings]

MC – What about you? How did you lose your wings?

"I was stupid and did stupid things."

“Is there anything else you want to ask me?”
