- fairies have green eyes in some folklore
- fairies like to confuse travelers on paths (another point in the trickster category)
- the Crataegus monogyna (specifically apparently) species of hawthorn is associated with the fae and typically isn't disturbed by those who believe in the danger of the fae
- names have power and knowing the name of a particular fairy means you could summon the fairy to you and force them to do your bidding, but could also be used to grant the summoner power and gifts??? 
- apparently fairies shapeshift in scotland. women shapeshift into deer and the fairy queen "in order to frighten a farmer who pastured his herd on fairy ground, a fairy queen took on the appearance of a great horse, with the wings of an eagle, and a tail like a dragon, hissing loud and spitting fire. Then she would change into a little man lame of a leg, with a bull's head, and a lambent flame playing round it" Coat of arms ideas maybe??? Deer references in the court? maybe like a deer statue or deer motifs or a deer brooch idk something with deer
- ("Sir Orfeo" tells how Sir Orfeo's wife was kidnapped by the King of Faerie and only by trickery and excellent harping ability was he able to win her back.) Ok we gotta use a harp in something now so we can laugh eternally at our own inside joke that no one else gets
- they make fool's gold
