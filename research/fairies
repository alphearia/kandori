- fairies have green eyes in some folklore
- fairies like to confuse travelers on paths (another point in the trickster category)
- the Crataegus monogyna (specifically apparently) species of hawthorn is associated with the fae and typically isn't disturbed by those who believe in the danger of the fae
- names have power and knowing the name of a particular fairy means you could summon the fairy to you and force them to do your bidding, but could also be used to grant the summoner power and gifts??? 
- apparently fairies shapeshift in scotland. women shapeshift into deer and the fairy queen "in order to frighten a farmer who pastured his herd on fairy ground, a fairy queen took on the appearance of a great horse, with the wings of an eagle, and a tail like a dragon, hissing loud and spitting fire. Then she would change into a little man lame of a leg, with a bull's head, and a lambent flame playing round it" Coat of arms ideas maybe??? Deer references in the court? maybe like a deer statue or deer motifs or a deer brooch idk something with deer
